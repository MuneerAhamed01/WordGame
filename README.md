# english_wordle

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


Firebase Tools for Your Wordle-Like App:
* Firebase Authentication: This is essential for managing user accounts. You can use email/password, phone number, or social logins to let users sign in and track their progress.
* Cloud Firestore: This is a great choice for storing your app's data, including:
    * User data: You can store user profiles, including their email, age, mobile number (optional), work, level of English, and any other relevant information.
    * Game data: Store the daily word, hints, and user game progress (streak, points, hints used, etc.).
    * Word history: Keep track of past words and user performance.
* Firebase Remote Config: This allows you to update the daily word and hints without requiring an app update. You can easily change the word list, difficulty, or even add new features remotely.
* Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM): Use FCM to send notifications to users, reminding them to play daily or congratulating them on their streaks.
* Firebase Hosting: Host your web app on Firebase's no-cost hosting platform. It's easy to set up and scales automatically.
* Firebase Functions: Use Cloud Functions to handle server-side logic, such as:
    * Generating random words: Create a function to select a random word for each day.
    * Calculating points: Implement a function to calculate points based on the number of guesses and time taken.
    * Providing hints: Create a function to generate hints based on the word.
* Firebase Crashlytics: Track and monitor any crashes or errors in your app to ensure a smooth user experience.
* Firebase Performance Monitoring: Analyze your app's performance to identify areas for improvement and optimize user experience.
Additional Considerations:
* Word List: You'll need a good source of English words for your game. You can use a pre-existing word list or create your own.
* Difficulty Levels: Consider adding difficulty levels to cater to different skill levels. You could adjust the word length or complexity.
* Social Features: Think about adding social features, such as leaderboards or the ability to share scores with friends.
Getting Started:
1. Create a Firebase Project: Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.
2. Set Up Authentication: Enable email/password authentication or other methods you prefer.
3. Choose a Database: Set up Cloud Firestore to store your app's data.
4. Build Your App: Use your preferred development tools (React, Angular, Flutter, etc.) to build your web and mobile apps.
5. Integrate Firebase: Integrate the Firebase SDKs into your app to access the features you need.
6. Test and Deploy: Thoroughly test your app and deploy it to Firebase Hosting.
